config TICK_ONESHOT
	bool

config NO_HZ
	bool "Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select TICK_ONESHOT
	help
	  This option enables a tickless system: timer interrupts will
	  only trigger on an as-needed basis both when the system is
	  busy and when the system is idle.

config NO_HZ_EXTENDED
       bool "Full dynticks system"
       depends on NO_HZ && RCU_USER_QS && VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN && RCU_NOCB_CPU && SMP
       select CONTEXT_TRACKING_FORCE
       help
         Adaptively try to shutdown the tick whenever possible, even when
	 the CPU is running tasks. Typically this requires running a single
	 task on the CPU. Chances for running tickless are maximized when
	 the task mostly runs in userspace and has few kernel activity.

	 You need to fill up the nohz_extended boot parameter with the
	 desired range of dynticks CPUs.

	 This is implemented at the expense of some overhead in user <-> kernel
	 transitions: syscalls, exceptions and interrupts. Even when it's
	 dynamically off.

	 Say N.

config HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	bool "High Resolution Timer Support"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select TICK_ONESHOT
	help
	  This option enables high resolution timer support. If your
	  hardware is not capable then this option only increases
	  the size of the kernel image.

config GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS_BUILD
	bool
	default y
	depends on GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS

config GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS_MIN_ADJUST
